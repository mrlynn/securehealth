# üëê RUN: Authentication Challenge 

:::info
The provided scripts are incomplete. Replace all `<CODE_BLOCK>` with the correct code to complete the lab.
:::

> Hint: Remember to add `--projectId {project_id}`


### 1. Create a SCRAM user

```python
# create a SCRAM user with username: "myUser", password: "mySecurePassword" and role: "readWriteAnyDatabase"
username = "myUser"
password = "mySecurePassword"
!atlas dbusers create <CODE_BLOCK>
```
> Refer to documentation: [atlas dbusers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/current/command/atlas-dbusers-create/)

    ```python
    # create a SCRAM user with username: "myUser", password: "mySecurePassword" and role: "readWriteAnyDatabase"
    username = "myUser"
    password = "mySecurePassword"
    !atlas dbusers create --username {username} --password {password} --role readWriteAnyDatabase --projectId {project_id}
    ```
</details>
:::

### 2. Let's test our SCRAM user successful creation by performing the authentication process

```python
!pip install pymongo dnspython  
```

```python
# retrieve connection string
connection = !atlas clusters connectionStrings describe  MyNewCluster --projectId {project_id}

# add username and password to connection string
new_connection = connection[1].replace('mongodb+srv://', f'mongodb+srv://{username}:{password}@')
print(new_connection)

#make the connection get the list of databases
from pymongo import MongoClient
client = MongoClient(new_connection)
client.list_database_names()
```

### 3. Create a X509 user and certificate

```python
# create a Atlas-managed X509 user with username: "myX509User" and role: "readAnyDatabase" 
!atlas dbusers create <CODE_BLOCK>
```
> Refer to documentation: [atlas dbusers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/current/command/atlas-dbusers-create/)
```python
# Generate a certification for "myX509user", set monthsUntilExpiration to 1, and save it to /tmp/cert.pem
!atlas dbusers certs create <CODE_BLOCK> > /tmp/cert.pem
```
> Refer to documentation: [atlas dbusers certs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/current/command/atlas-dbusers-certs-create/)

    ```python
    # create a Atlas-managed X509 user with username: "myX509User" and role: "readAnyDatabase" 
    !atlas dbusers create --username myX509User --role readAnyDatabase --x509Type MANAGED --projectId {project_id}
    ```
    ```python
    # Generate a certification for "myX509user", set monthsUntilExpiration to 1, and save it to /tmp/cert.pem
    !atlas dbusers certs create --username myX509User --monthsUntilExpiration 1 --projectId {project_id} > /tmp/cert.pem
    ```
</details>

### 4. Let's test our X509 user

```python
# Get connection string
connection = !atlas clusters connectionStrings describe MyNewCluster --projectId {project_id}

# Modify connection string to use X509 as authentication mechanism 
new_connection = connection[1].replace('.net', '.net?authSource=%24external&authMechanism=MONGODB-X509')
print(new_connection)

# Connect using the certificate
from pymongo import MongoClient
client = MongoClient(new_connection,
                     tlsCertificateKeyFile='/tmp/cert.pem')

# Access the database
client.list_database_names()
```
