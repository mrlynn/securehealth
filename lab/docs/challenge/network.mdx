### 1. Add "My current IP" temporary into the atlas project

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo 

# Calculate the date and time 24 hours from now
delete_after = (datetime.now(ZoneInfo('UTC')) + timedelta(hours=24)).isoformat()

!atlas accessLists <CODE_BLOCK>
```

    <summary> Answer </summary>
    ```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo 

# Calculate the date and time 24 hours from now
delete_after = (datetime.now(ZoneInfo('UTC')) + timedelta(hours=24)).isoformat()

!atlas accessLists <CODE_BLOCK> --projectId {project_id} --deleteAfter {delete_after}
```
</details>

:::info
The IP added is the "local" IP for the environment running the notebook. If you're running this in Collab / Codespaces this local IP will not be your computer's local IP.
:::

### 2. Check that "My current IP" was added
```python
!atlas accessLists list --output json --projectId {project_id}
```

You should get a JSON document that contains information in the `results` array.
