# MongoDB Security Basics

Welcome to the MongoDB Security Basics guide. This comprehensive tutorial covers essential security concepts and implementations for both MongoDB Atlas and On-premises deployments.

## Overview

This guide is structured to help you understand and implement MongoDB security features effectively. Each section provides side-by-side comparisons of implementing security features in both MongoDB Atlas and On-premises environments.

In the navigation bar and in some pages, you will notice some icons. Here are their meanings:

|Icon|Meaning| Description
|-|-|-|
|üìò|Lecture material|If you are following along in an instructor-led session, they probably have covered this already.|
|üëê|Hands-on content|Get ready to do some hands-on work. You should follow these steps.|
|üìö|Documentation| Reference documentation for hands-on portions of the lab.|
|ü¶π|Advanced content|This content isn't covered during the lab, but if you're interested in learning more, you can check it out.|

## Topics covered

### 1. Intro and network security
Explore Atlas-specific security features:
- Network access controls
- Private endpoints

Explore self-hosted considerations for network security.

### 2. Authentication
Learn about different authentication mechanisms and how to:
- Set up user authentication.
- Implement X.509 certificate authentication.
- Manage credentials securely.

### 3. Role-based access control (RBAC)
Understand how to:
- Create and manage roles.
- Assign privileges to roles.
- Implement role inheritance.
- Follow security best practices for access control.

### 4. Queryable encryption

Learn how to handle your sensitive information with our most advanced encryption technique:
- Set up encryption keys.
- Create an encrypted client.
- Write and read encrypted field data.


### 5. Security considerations and summary
Learn about additional Atlas and self-hosted security configurations:
- System hardening
- Encryption options
- Database auditing
- Backup security
- Audit logging
- Backup strategies

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before implementing security measures, ensure you have:

1. **MongoDB Atlas users**
   - An Atlas account
   - Access to a notebook environment to install Atlas CLI on.

   **Recommended one of:**
   - [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), for general concepts: [Get yourself familiar with Jupyter Notebooks](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/vector-search-lab/docs/dev-env/jupyter-notebooks). 
   - [Github Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/getting-started-with-github-codespaces-for-machine-learning)
   - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) 

2. **On-premises users**
   - MongoDB installed
   - Administrative access
   - Basic understanding of Linux/Unix systems

## Using this guide

Each section provides:
- Side-by-side comparisons of Atlas and On-premises implementations.
- Practical code examples.
- Best practices.
- Security checklists.
- Hands-on exercises by using `.ipynb` notebooks.

### Tab navigation

Throughout this guide, you'll find content organized in tabs:
- **Atlas**: MongoDB Atlas-specific instructions
- **On-premises**: Self-hosted deployment instructions

This allows you to focus on the content relevant to your deployment type while understanding the differences between approaches.

## Security best practices

Regardless of your deployment type, always:

1. **Network security**
   - Restrict network access.
   - Use TLS/SSL encryption.
   - Implement proper firewall rules.

2. **Enable authentication**
   - Never run MongoDB without authentication.
   - Use strong passwords.
   - Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms.

2. **Use access controls**
   - Follow the principle of least privilege.
   - Regularly audit user access.
   - Implement role-based access control.

4. **Use queryable encryption**
   - Set up queryable encryption.
   - Create database encrypted client and collections.
   - Read and write encrypted documents.

## Next steps

1. Start with [Initial Setup](./setup) to get started on completing the challenge sections.
2. Progress to [Network Setup](./atlas) for authorising access and [Authentication](./authentication) for database user management and [Authorization](./rbac).
3. Explore [queryable encryption](./queryable-encryption) for document-based security.
4. Finally, recap everything in Security Considerations and Summary.
