# Workshop Outline

## Introduction

This workshop provides a hands-on experience with MongoDB security features. You will learn how to configure network security, implement authentication, manage user permissions with role-based access control (RBAC), and encrypt data with queryable encryption.

## Goals

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

*   Set up network access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
*   Implement different authentication methods.
*   Manage user permissions using RBAC.
*   Encrypt data at rest and in transit while still being able to query it.
