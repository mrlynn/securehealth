   - Separate Docker environment isolated from production
   - Test data generator with synthetic PHI

2. **Monitoring Tools**
   - Network traffic analyzer (e.g., Wireshark)
   - MongoDB query analyzer
   - CPU/Memory utilization monitoring

3. **Security Testing Tools**
   - MongoDB Database Assessment Tool
   - Custom encryption validation scripts
   - Database inspection tools
