# Patient Portal Implementation

## Overview

The SecureHealth Patient Portal provides patients with secure, HIPAA-compliant access to their medical information. Built on the existing securehealth.dev infrastructure, it extends the system with patient-facing capabilities while maintaining the highest security standards.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Patient Registration**: Self-service account creation with email verification
- **Secure Authentication**: Session-based login with patient role verification
- **Medical Records Access**: View personal medical information with appropriate filtering
- **Profile Management**: Update contact information and personal details
- **Medication Management**: View current medications and dosage information
- **Insurance Information**: Access insurance details and coverage information

### Security Features
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Full compliance with healthcare data protection standards
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Patients can only access their own records
- **Data Encryption**: All data encrypted using MongoDB Queryable Encryption
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all patient portal activities
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic timeout
- **Access Controls**: Patients cannot access sensitive provider notes or SSN

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. User Model Extensions (`src/Document/User.php`)
```php
// New fields for patient users
private bool $isPatient = false;
private $patientId = null; // Links to Patient document
```

#### 2. Patient Portal API Controller (`src/Controller/Api/PatientPortalController.php`)
- `/api/patient-portal/register` - Patient registration
- `/api/patient-portal/login` - Patient authentication (uses existing login endpoint)
- `/api/patient-portal/dashboard` - Dashboard data
- `/api/patient-portal/my-records` - Medical records access
- `/api/patient-portal/my-records` (PUT) - Update profile information

#### 3. Enhanced Security Voter (`src/Security/Voter/PatientVoter.php`)
- `PATIENT_VIEW_OWN` - Patients can only view their own records
- `PATIENT_EDIT_OWN` - Patients can only edit limited fields of their own records

#### 4. Patient Data Filtering (`src/Document/Patient.php`)
Patients can see:
- Basic demographics (name, email, phone, birth date)
- Current medications
- Insurance information
- Cannot see: SSN, diagnosis details, provider notes

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Patient Portal Landing Page (`public/patient-portal/index.html`)
- Feature overview and security information
- Links to registration and login

#### 2. Registration Page (`public/patient-portal/register.html`)
- Patient account creation form
- Terms of service and privacy policy
- Form validation and error handling

#### 3. Login Page (`public/patient-portal/login.html`)
- Secure authentication interface
- Password visibility toggle
- Session management

#### 4. Dashboard (`public/patient-portal/dashboard.html`)
- Patient overview with personal information
- Current medications display
- Insurance information
- Quick actions for common tasks
- Navigation to detailed records

#### 5. Test Suite (`public/patient-portal/test-portal.html`)
- Comprehensive testing interface
- Registration, login, and functionality tests
- Security validation tests

## Security Implementation

### Access Control
```yaml
# Security configuration for patient portal
- { path: ^/api/patient-portal/register, roles: PUBLIC_ACCESS }
- { path: ^/api/patient-portal, roles: ROLE_PATIENT }
- { path: ^/api/patient-portal/my-records, roles: ROLE_PATIENT }
```

### Data Access Rules
- **Patients**: Can only access their own records with filtered data
- **Healthcare Staff**: Maintain existing access levels (doctor, nurse, receptionist)
- **Admins**: Cannot access medical data, only basic patient info

### Audit Logging
All patient portal activities are logged:
- Registration attempts
- Login/logout events
- Data access and modifications
- Profile updates
- Dashboard visits

## User Roles

### ROLE_PATIENT
- Access to own medical records (filtered)
- Update personal contact information
- View medications and insurance info
- Cannot access SSN or provider notes
- Cannot access other patients' records

## API Endpoints

### Patient Registration
```http
POST /api/patient-portal/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123",
  "birthDate": "1990-01-01",
  "phoneNumber": "555-123-4567"
}
```

### Patient Login (uses existing endpoint)
```http
POST /api/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "_username": "john.doe@example.com",
  "_password": "securepassword123"
}
```

### Get Dashboard Data
```http
GET /api/patient-portal/dashboard
Authorization: Session cookie
```

### Get Medical Records
```http
GET /api/patient-portal/my-records
Authorization: Session cookie
```

### Update Profile
```http
PUT /api/patient-portal/my-records
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Session cookie

{
  "firstName": "John",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "555-987-6543"
}
```

## Testing

### Test Suite Access
Navigate to `/patient-portal/test-portal.html` to access the comprehensive test suite.

### Test Data
Use the following test data for development and testing:
```
Email: test.patient@example.com
Password: testpassword123
First Name: Test
Last Name: Patient
Birth Date: 1990-01-01
Phone: 555-123-4567
```

### Test Coverage
- Patient registration flow
- Authentication and session management
- Dashboard data loading
- Medical records access
- Security validation (unauthorized access prevention)
- Complete end-to-end flow
