# HIPAA Compliance Guide

This document outlines how the SecureHealth application meets HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance requirements.

## Key HIPAA Requirements Implemented

### 1. Access Controls (§164.312(a)(1))

**Requirement**: Implement technical policies and procedures for electronic information systems that maintain electronic PHI to allow access only to authorized persons or software programs.

**Implementation**:
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for all patient data
- Authentication required for all API endpoints
- Different permission levels (doctor, nurse, receptionist)
- Data filtering based on user role

**Code References**:
- `src/Security/Voter/PatientVoter.php`: Enforces access control rules
- `src/Document/Patient.php`: `toArray()` method filters sensitive data based on user role
- `config/packages/security.yaml`: Defines authentication and authorization rules

### 2. Audit Controls (§164.312(b))

**Requirement**: Implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic PHI.

**Implementation**:
- Comprehensive audit logging of all system activities
- Logging of all data access (who, what, when)
- IP address tracking
- Action type categorization

**Code References**:
- `src/Document/AuditLog.php`: Schema for storing audit events
- `src/Service/AuditLogService.php`: Service for logging events
- `src/EventSubscriber/AuditLogSubscriber.php`: Automatic event logging
- `src/Controller/Api/AuditLogController.php`: API for accessing audit logs

### 3. Integrity (§164.312(c)(1))

**Requirement**: Implement policies and procedures to protect electronic PHI from improper alteration or destruction.

**Implementation**:
- Only authorized users can modify patient data
- All modifications are logged with before/after values
- Validation of data input

**Code References**:
- `src/Controller/Api/PatientController.php`: Enforces validation and authorization
- Audit logging captures all data modifications

### 4. Transmission Security (§164.312(e)(1))

**Requirement**: Implement technical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to electronic PHI that is being transmitted over a network.

**Implementation**:
- MongoDB client-side encryption for data at rest
- Different encryption levels based on data sensitivity
- Searchable encryption for necessary fields

**Code References**:
- `src/Service/MongoDBEncryptionService.php`: Configures and manages encryption
- `src/Factory/MongoDBConnectionFactory.php`: Creates encrypted connections

### 5. Authentication (§164.312(d))

**Requirement**: Implement procedures to verify that a person or entity seeking access to electronic PHI is the one claimed.

**Implementation**:
- Strong password authentication
- Session-based authentication system
- Role verification for all operations

**Code References**:
- `config/packages/security.yaml`: Authentication configuration
- `src/Controller/Api/SecurityController.php`: Login and logout handling

## Protected Health Information (PHI) Handling

The following patient information is considered PHI and is protected accordingly:

| Data Type | Encryption Type | Access Level | Search Capability |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| Name | Deterministic | All Roles | Exact Match |
| Birth Date | Range | Doctor Only | Range Queries |
| SSN | Standard | Doctor Only | None |
| Diagnosis | Standard | Doctor Only | None |
| Medications | None | Doctor, Nurse | Full |
| Contact Info | None | All Roles | Full |

## Audit Log Events

The following events are logged for HIPAA compliance:

### Security Events
- User login (successful and failed)
- User logout
- Permission changes

### Patient Data Events
- Patient record creation
- Patient record viewing
- Patient record updates
- Patient record deletion
- Patient search operations

### Administrative Events
- Configuration changes
- User management operations

## Data Encryption Strategy

1. **Deterministic Encryption**:
   - Used for: Last name, other searchable identifiers
   - Properties: Same input always produces same encrypted output
   - Search capabilities: Exact match queries only

2. **Range Encryption**:
   - Used for: Birth dates, numeric values
   - Properties: Preserves order relationships
   - Search capabilities: Less than, greater than, equal to

3. **Standard Encryption**:
   - Used for: SSN, diagnosis, other sensitive data
   - Properties: Maximum security, completely randomized
   - Search capabilities: None, requires full decryption

## HIPAA Compliance Checklist

## Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only have access to the minimum data necessary
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: All activities are logged for audit purposes
4. **Data Minimization**: Only collecting necessary patient information
5. **Encryption**: Both data at rest and in transit are encrypted

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Unauthorized data access | Role-based access control, encryption, audit logs |
| Data breach | Encryption of sensitive data, monitoring of access patterns |
| Internal misuse | Comprehensive audit logging, least privilege principle |
| System vulnerabilities | Regular updates, security testing, dependency scanning |

## Incident Response Plan

In case of a security incident:

1. **Detection**: Monitoring systems and audit logs identify suspicious activity
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems and revoke compromised credentials
3. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact of the incident
4. **Notification**: Follow HIPAA breach notification requirements
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems and data from secure backups
6. **Analysis**: Review logs and systems to determine root cause
7. **Prevention**: Implement measures to prevent similar incidents

## HIPAA Training Recommendations

All personnel with access to the system should receive training on:

1. HIPAA regulations and requirements
2. Proper handling of PHI
3. System security features
4. Recognition of security incidents
5. Reporting procedures for potential breaches

## Regular Compliance Reviews

Schedule regular reviews of:

1. Access control configurations
2. Audit log contents
3. Encryption implementation
4. Authentication mechanisms
5. Overall security posture
