## INTRO (1.5 minutes)

### Visual: Screen showing title card with MongoDB logo

**[Michael on camera, enthusiastic energy]**

"Hey everyone, Michael Lynn here! Today I want to show you something that's going to change how you think about building healthcare applications.

For years, developers have been stuck in this impossible situation: you need to encrypt patient data to comply with HIPAA, but the moment you encrypt everything, you can't search it anymore. You're forced to choose between security and functionality.

Well, not anymore.

In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to show you how to build a complete, production-ready medical records system using MongoDB's Queryable Encryption. We're talking:
- Searching encrypted data WITHOUT decrypting it
- Role-based access control with 5 different healthcare roles
- Complete medical knowledge base with clinical decision support
- Staff messaging system
- Appointment scheduling
- Patient portal
- Comprehensive audit logging
- And it's all surprisingly simple

This isn't a toy demo - this is a real system you could deploy today. Let's dive in!"

### Visual: Quick montage of final application
- Patient search interface with role-based navigation
- Encrypted data in MongoDB Compass
- Medical knowledge base search
- Staff messaging interface
- Appointment calendar
- Patient portal
- Audit logs showing access trails
- Different role views (Doctor, Nurse, Admin, Receptionist, Patient)

## PART 1: THE PROBLEM & SOLUTION (2 minutes)

### Visual: Screen showing a diagram of traditional encryption problems

**[Sharing screen, pointing to diagram]**

"Alright, so let's talk about the problem first. Healthcare data breaches are a BIG deal - we're talking an average cost of $7.8 million per incident. HIPAA exists for good reason.

**[Show traditional encryption diagram]**

The traditional approach looks like this:

Option 1: Encrypt the entire database
- Problem: Can't search anything
- Have to decrypt everything to find anything
- Performance nightmare

Option 2: Application-layer encryption
- Problem: Massive complexity
- Keys everywhere
- Still can't query encrypted fields

Option 3: Tokenization
- Problem: Complexity explosion
- Maintaining token mappings
- Still limited query capability

**[Pause for emphasis]**

None of these feel right! We want the best of both worlds.

**[Show MongoDB Queryable Encryption logo/diagram]**

Enter MongoDB Queryable Encryption. This changes everything. It lets us search encrypted data WITHOUT decrypting it on the server. The database never sees your plaintext data. Ever.

But here's what makes this system special - it's not just about encryption. It's a complete healthcare application with:
- 5 different user roles with appropriate permissions
- Medical knowledge base for clinical decision support
- Staff messaging system
- Appointment scheduling
- Patient portal for self-service
- Comprehensive audit logging for HIPAA compliance

Let me show you how it all works together."

## PART 2: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & ROLES (2.5 minutes)

### Visual: Architecture diagram animation

**[Animated diagram showing complete system]**

"Here's our complete architecture. It's actually beautifully simple:

**[Point to frontend]**

We've got a web interface built with HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. But here's the key - it's role-aware. Each user sees a completely different interface based on their role.

**[Point to API layer]**

Behind that is our Symfony 7.0 backend API. This is where the magic happens:
- Session-based authentication (not JWT - I'll explain why)
- Fine-grained role-based access control with Symfony Voters
- Encryption service that handles all our crypto
- Medical knowledge service for clinical decision support
- Messaging service for staff communication
- Audit logging service for HIPAA compliance

**[Point to MongoDB]**

And then MongoDB Atlas with Queryable Encryption. This is our secret weapon.

**[Show role hierarchy]**

Let me show you our role system:

**ROLE_ADMIN**: System administration, audit logs, demo data, encryption management
**ROLE_DOCTOR**: Full patient access, clinical tools, medical knowledge, audit logs
**ROLE_NURSE**: Limited patient access, drug interactions, view notes
**ROLE_RECEPTIONIST**: Basic patient info, scheduling, insurance management
**ROLE_PATIENT**: Patient portal, view own records, messaging with staff

**[Animate data flow with role-based access]**

Now watch what happens when a doctor searches for a patient named 'Smith':

1. Doctor types 'Smith' in the search box
2. Frontend sends session cookie to API
3. Symfony validates: 'Are you a doctor? Cool.'
4. Encryption service encrypts 'Smith' using deterministic encryption
5. MongoDB searches the encrypted field
6. MongoDB returns encrypted results
7. Symfony decrypts them - but only the fields the doctor can see
8. Audit service logs: 'Dr. Jones searched for Smith'
9. Response goes back to the frontend

**[Highlight the key point]**

The beautiful part? MongoDB NEVER sees 'Smith' in plaintext. Even if someone hacks the database, they get encrypted gibberish. Even your database administrators can't read patient data.

This is called 'zero-knowledge' security, and it's a game-changer."

---

## PART 3: SETTING UP THE ENVIRONMENT (2 minutes)

### Visual: MongoDB Atlas interface

**[Show MongoDB Atlas dashboard]**

"Alright, let's build this thing! First step: MongoDB Atlas setup.

**[Click through Atlas interface]**

I'm creating an M10 cluster here - that's the minimum tier for Queryable Encryption. You'll need:
1. MongoDB Atlas cluster (M10+)
2. Queryable Encryption enabled
3. A key vault namespace

**[Show key vault setup]**

The key vault is where MongoDB stores your Data Encryption Keys. These are encrypted by your Customer Master Key, which we're going to generate now.

**[Switch to terminal]**

In production, you'd use AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault for this, but for development, we can use a local key:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 96 > docker/encryption.key
```

**[Show the key file]**

96 bytes of pure randomness. This is what protects everything.

**Important:** Never commit this to Git. Add it to .gitignore immediately.

**[Show Docker Compose file]**

Here's our Docker setup. Two containers:
- PHP/Symfony
- Nginx

We're pointing to MongoDB Atlas, and we're mounting our encryption key.

**[Terminal: docker-compose up]**

Let's fire it up:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec php composer install
php bin/console app:create-users  # Create demo users
```

And we're running! We even have demo users for all roles."

---

## PART 4: THE ENCRYPTION SERVICE - THE HEART OF THE SYSTEM (3 minutes)

### Visual: Code editor showing MongoDBEncryptionService.php

**[Open MongoDBEncryptionService.php]**

"This right here is the heart of our system: the MongoDBEncryptionService.

**[Scroll through the class]**

It handles three things:
1. Deciding what gets encrypted and how
2. Encrypting data before it goes to MongoDB
3. Decrypting data when we read it back

**[Highlight the encryption algorithms]**

We have three encryption types:

```php
const ALGORITHM_DETERMINISTIC = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic';
const ALGORITHM_RANDOM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random';
const ALGORITHM_RANGE = 'range';
```

**[Explain each one]**

Deterministic: Same input always gives same encrypted output. This means we can search it! Use it for names, emails, phone numbers.

Random: Maximum security. Same input gives different encrypted output every time. Can't search it, but it's super secure. Use it for SSN, diagnoses, medical notes.

Range: For dates and numbers. Enables range queries on encrypted data. We're not using it in this demo, but in production you'd want it for birth dates.

**[Show the configuration method]**

Here's where we decide what gets encrypted:

```php
private function configureEncryptedFieldsDefinitions(): void
{
    $this->encryptedFields['patient'] = [
        // Searchable fields
        'lastName' => ['algorithm' => self::ALGORITHM_DETERMINISTIC],
        'firstName' => ['algorithm' => self::ALGORITHM_DETERMINISTIC],
        'email' => ['algorithm' => self::ALGORITHM_DETERMINISTIC],
        
        // Super sensitive - no search
        'ssn' => ['algorithm' => self::ALGORITHM_RANDOM],
        'diagnosis' => ['algorithm' => self::ALGORITHM_RANDOM],
        'medications' => ['algorithm' => self::ALGORITHM_RANDOM],
    ];
}
```

**[Point to the encrypt method]**

The encrypt method is surprisingly simple:

```php
public function encrypt(string $documentType, string $fieldName, $value): Binary
{
    // Get the config
    $config = $this->encryptedFields[$documentType][$fieldName];
    
    // Get or create the Data Encryption Key
    $keyId = $this->getOrCreateDataKey("{$documentType}_{$fieldName}_key");
    
    // Encrypt!
    return $this->clientEncryption->encrypt($value, [
        'keyId' => $keyId,
        'algorithm' => $config['algorithm']
    ]);
}
```

**[Emphasize the key management]**

Notice we're using separate Data Encryption Keys for each field. This gives us granular control. If we need to rotate keys, we can do it field by field.

The MongoDB driver does all the heavy lifting. We just tell it what to encrypt and how."

---

## PART 5: ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL WITH SYMFONY VOTERS (2.5 minutes)

### Visual: Code editor showing PatientVoter.php

**[Open PatientVoter.php]**

"Now let's talk about authorization. This is where Symfony Voters really shine for healthcare applications.

**[Scroll through the voter class]**

Look at these granular permissions:

```php
public const VIEW = 'PATIENT_VIEW';
public const EDIT = 'PATIENT_EDIT';
public const VIEW_DIAGNOSIS = 'PATIENT_VIEW_DIAGNOSIS';
public const EDIT_DIAGNOSIS = 'PATIENT_EDIT_DIAGNOSIS';
public const VIEW_SSN = 'PATIENT_VIEW_SSN';
public const VIEW_INSURANCE = 'PATIENT_VIEW_INSURANCE';
public const PATIENT_VIEW_OWN = 'PATIENT_VIEW_OWN';
```

**[Show the voteOnAttribute method]**

Here's how we decide permissions:

```php
private function canViewDiagnosis(array $roles): bool
{
    // Only doctors and nurses can view medical data
    return in_array('ROLE_DOCTOR', $roles) || 
           in_array('ROLE_NURSE', $roles);
}

private function canViewSSN(array $roles): bool
{
    // Only doctors can view SSN
    return in_array('ROLE_DOCTOR', $roles);
}
```

**[Show controller usage]**

In our controllers, checking permissions is clean and declarative:

```php
public function show(Patient $patient): Response
{
    // Check if user can view this patient
    $this->denyAccessUnlessGranted(PatientVoter::VIEW, $patient);
    
    // Get basic patient data
    $data = $patient->toArray();
    
    // Conditionally include sensitive fields based on permissions
    if ($this->isGranted(PatientVoter::VIEW_DIAGNOSIS, $patient)) {
        $data['diagnosis'] = $patient->getDiagnosis();
    }
    
    if ($this->isGranted(PatientVoter::VIEW_SSN, $patient)) {
        $data['ssn'] = $patient->getSsn();
    }
    
    return $this->json($data);
}
```

**[Pause for emphasis]**

This is HIPAA's 'minimum necessary' rule in code. Each role sees only what they need to do their job.

We also have a MedicalKnowledgeVoter for controlling access to clinical tools, and the system automatically logs every permission check for audit compliance."

---

## PART 6: SEARCHING ENCRYPTED DATA - THE MAGIC (2 minutes)

### Visual: Code editor showing PatientRepository.php

**[Open PatientRepository.php, show findByLastName method]**

"Okay, this is where it gets really cool. Let's search for a patient by last name.

Remember, lastName is encrypted. So how do we search it?

```php
public function findByLastName(string $lastName, MongoDBEncryptionService $encryptionService): array
{
    // Step 1: Encrypt the search term
    $encryptedLastName = $encryptionService->encrypt('patient', 'lastName', $lastName);
    
    // Step 2: Search using the encrypted value
    $cursor = $collection->find(['lastName' => $encryptedLastName]);
    
    // Step 3: Decrypt the results
    foreach ($cursor as $document) {
        $patients[] = Patient::fromDocument($document, $encryptionService);
    }
    
    return $patients;
}
```

**[Break it down step by step]**

Here's what's happening:

1. User searches for 'Smith'
2. We encrypt 'Smith' using deterministic encryption
3. MongoDB searches for that EXACT encrypted value
4. Because we used deterministic encryption, all 'Smith' entries have the same encrypted value
5. MongoDB finds them WITHOUT decrypting anything
6. We get the results back (still encrypted)
7. We decrypt them before returning to the user

**[Switch to MongoDB Compass]**

Let me show you what this looks like in the database.

**[Show MongoDB Compass with encrypted data]**

See these Binary objects? That's encrypted data. Even looking directly at the database, you can't see 'Smith'. You just see random bytes.

But our application can search it!

**[Switch back to code]**

The key is using the SAME encryption algorithm and key. That's why deterministic encryption works for searching."

---

## PART 7: MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE BASE & CLINICAL TOOLS (2 minutes)

### Visual: Medical knowledge search interface

**[Show medical knowledge search page]**

"Now let's talk about the clinical tools. This is where the system really shines for healthcare providers.

**[Show search interface]**

We have a comprehensive medical knowledge base that includes:
- Clinical decision support
- Drug interaction checking
- Treatment guidelines
- Diagnostic criteria
- Medical reference materials

**[Show search results]**

Here's a search for 'diabetes treatment':

**[Show results with role-based access]**

Notice how the results are filtered based on the user's role. Doctors see everything, nurses see limited information, and receptionists don't see medical content at all.

**[Show drug interactions tool]**

And here's our drug interaction checker:

**[Show drug interaction interface]**

Doctors can check for interactions between multiple medications. This is critical for patient safety.

**[Show code for medical knowledge voter]**

The access control is handled by our MedicalKnowledgeVoter:

```php
private function canAccessClinicalDecisionSupport(array $roles): bool
{
    // Only doctors can access clinical decision support
    return in_array('ROLE_DOCTOR', $roles);
}

private function canCheckDrugInteractions(array $roles): bool
{
    // Doctors and nurses can check drug interactions
    return in_array('ROLE_DOCTOR', $roles) || 
           in_array('ROLE_NURSE', $roles);
}
```

**[Show audit logging]**

Every search is logged for HIPAA compliance. We track who searched for what, when, and why."

---

## PART 8: STAFF MESSAGING SYSTEM (1.5 minutes)

### Visual: Messaging interface

**[Show staff messaging interface]**

"Healthcare is a team sport. Doctors, nurses, and other staff need to communicate about patients.

**[Show conversation list]**

Our messaging system allows:
- Staff-to-staff messaging
- Patient-to-staff messaging
- Conversation threading
- Real-time unread message counts

**[Show message composition]**

Here's a doctor sending a message to a nurse about a patient:

**[Show message with patient context]**

Notice how the message includes patient context but doesn't expose PHI in the conversation history. This is HIPAA compliant.

**[Show code for messaging service]**

The messaging system uses the same encryption and access control patterns:

```php
public function sendMessage(User $sender, User $recipient, string $content, ?Patient $patient = null): Message
{
    // Check permissions
    $this->denyAccessUnlessGranted(MessageVoter::SEND, $message);
    
    // Create message
    $message = new Message();
    $message->setSender($sender);
    $message->setRecipient($recipient);
    $message->setContent($content);
    
    // Log the action
    $this->auditLogService->log($sender, 'MESSAGE_SENT', [
        'recipient' => $recipient->getUserIdentifier(),
        'patientId' => $patient?->getId()
    ]);
    
    return $this->messageRepository->save($message);
}
```

**[Show real-time updates]**

The system polls for new messages every 15 seconds and updates the navbar badge in real-time."

---

## PART 9: PATIENT PORTAL (1.5 minutes)

### Visual: Patient portal interface

**[Show patient portal login]**

"Patients need access to their own information too. That's where our patient portal comes in.

**[Show patient dashboard]**

The patient portal provides:
- View own medical records
- Update contact information
- Message healthcare providers
- View appointment history
- Request appointments

**[Show patient's view of their records]**

Here's what a patient sees when they view their own records:

**[Show patient record view]**

Notice how the patient can see their own information but can't edit medical data. That's controlled by our PatientVoter:

```php
private function canViewOwn(Patient $patient, UserInterface $user): bool
{
    // Patients can only view their own records
    if (!in_array('ROLE_PATIENT', $user->getRoles())) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if the patient is accessing their own record
    return $user->getPatientId() && 
           (string)$user->getPatientId() === (string)$patient->getId();
}
```

**[Show patient messaging]**

Patients can message their healthcare providers:

**[Show patient message interface]**

This creates a conversation thread that both the patient and staff can see, but with appropriate access controls."

---

## PART 10: AUDIT LOGGING & HIPAA COMPLIANCE (2 minutes)

### Visual: Audit log interface

**[Show audit log interface]**

"HIPAA requires comprehensive audit logs. Every access to patient data must be logged.

**[Show audit log entries]**

Our AuditLogService captures:
- Who accessed the data
- What they accessed
- When they accessed it
- From where (IP address)
- What action they performed

**[Show audit log code]**

```php
public function logPatientAccess(UserInterface $user, string $accessType, string $patientId): AuditLog
{
    $auditLog = new AuditLog();
    $auditLog->setUsername($user->getUserIdentifier());
    $auditLog->setActionType('PATIENT_' . $accessType);
    $auditLog->setEntityId($patientId);
    $auditLog->setTimestamp(new UTCDateTime());
    $auditLog->setIpAddress($request->getClientIp());
    
    // Save it
    $this->saveAuditLog($auditLog);
}
```

**[Show event subscriber]**

We use a Symfony Event Subscriber to log automatically:

```php
public function onKernelController(ControllerEvent $event): void
{
    if (str_starts_with($route, 'patient_')) {
        $this->auditLogService->logPatientAccess($user, $accessType, $patientId);
    }
}
```

**[Show audit log filtering]**

Admins and doctors can filter audit logs by:
- User
- Patient
- Date range
- Action type

**[Show compliance reporting]**

This makes it easy to generate compliance reports for HIPAA audits.

**Important:** Audit logs are NOT encrypted. They don't contain PHI - just metadata about who accessed what."

---

## PART 11: LIVE DEMO - COMPLETE WORKFLOW (3 minutes)

### Visual: Browser showing the application

**[Switch to browser showing the application]**

"Alright, let's see this in action! I'm going to show you a complete workflow.

**[Login as doctor]**

**[Show doctor login]**

**[Show doctor dashboard]**

Look at the navigation - doctors see Clinical Tools, Medical Knowledge, Audit Logs, and full patient access.

**[Search for a patient]**

Let's search for a patient:

**[Show patient search]**

I can search by last name even though it's encrypted!

**[Show patient details]**

Here's the patient record. As a doctor, I can see everything - SSN, diagnosis, medications, notes.

**[Add a patient note]**

Let me add a note about this patient:

**[Show note creation]**

**[Show medical knowledge search]**

Now let's search the medical knowledge base:

**[Show clinical decision support]**

Here's clinical decision support for diabetes management.

**[Check drug interactions]**

Let me check for drug interactions:

**[Show drug interaction results]**

**[Send a message to a nurse]**

Now let me send a message to a nurse about this patient:

**[Show message composition]**

**[Show message sent confirmation]**

**[Login as nurse]**

Now let's login as a nurse:

**[Show nurse dashboard]**

Notice the different navigation - nurses see Medical Tools but not Clinical Tools, and they can't see SSN.

**[Show same patient as nurse]**

Here's the same patient record, but the nurse can't see the SSN.

**[Show nurse's medical tools]**

Nurses can check drug interactions and view medical knowledge.

**[Show audit logs]**

Let's check the audit logs:

**[Show audit log entries]**

Every action is logged - doctor searched, doctor viewed patient, doctor sent message, nurse viewed patient.

**[Login as patient]**

Now let's see the patient portal:

**[Show patient portal login]**

**[Show patient dashboard]**

Here's what the patient sees - their own records, messages, appointments.

**[Show patient's view of their record]**

The patient can see their own information but can't edit medical data.

**[Show patient messaging]**

They can message their healthcare providers.

**[Show appointment history]**

And view their appointment history.

**[Back to doctor view]**

Let me switch back to doctor view to show the complete audit trail:

**[Show comprehensive audit log]**

Every single action is logged with timestamps, user information, and patient context. This is HIPAA compliant!"

---

## PART 12: PERFORMANCE & BEST PRACTICES (1.5 minutes)

### Visual: Performance comparison chart

**[Show performance benchmarks]**

"Let's talk performance. Yes, encryption has overhead:

- Deterministic encryption queries: 2-3x slower than unencrypted
  - Unencrypted: ~20ms
  - Encrypted: ~50ms
  - Still very acceptable

- Bulk operations: 2-3x slower
  - Still under a second for hundreds of records

**[Show optimization strategies]**

How we optimized:

1. **Selective Encryption** - Only encrypt PHI, not everything
2. **Smart Indexing** - Index searchable encrypted fields
3. **Projection** - Only retrieve fields you need
4. **Connection Pooling** - Reuse connections
5. **Role-based Data Filtering** - Only send data the user can see

**[Show best practices slide]**

Key best practices:

✅ Start with data classification
✅ Encrypt from day one (don't retrofit)
✅ Test with realistic data volumes
✅ Never log PHI
✅ Use cloud KMS in production (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault)
✅ Implement comprehensive audit logging
✅ Use role-based access control
✅ Test all user workflows

❌ Don't over-encrypt
❌ Don't ignore key rotation
❌ Don't trust client-side validation alone
❌ Don't skip audit logging"

## CLOSING (1.5 minutes)

### Visual: Summary slide

**[Back on camera]**

"And that's it! We just built a complete, production-ready HIPAA-compliant medical records system with:

✅ Field-level encryption with MongoDB Queryable Encryption
✅ Searchable encrypted data without decryption
✅ 5-role access control system (Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, Patient)
✅ Medical knowledge base with clinical decision support
✅ Staff messaging system
✅ Patient portal for self-service
✅ Appointment scheduling
✅ Comprehensive audit logging
✅ Zero-knowledge security

The beautiful thing about MongoDB Queryable Encryption is that it solves that impossible choice between security and functionality. You can have both.

**[Show repo link]**

All the code is on GitHub - link in the description. Clone it, play with it, build on it.

**[Production readiness checklist]**

Before going to production, remember:
1. Use AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault for key management
2. Enable MongoDB Atlas backups
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Get a security audit
5. Document everything
6. Test all user workflows
7. Implement proper error handling

**[Final thoughts]**

Healthcare data is personal. It's sensitive. It's about real people trusting their providers with their most private information. Building systems that respect that trust isn't just about compliance - it's about doing the right thing.

This system demonstrates that you can build secure, functional healthcare applications that protect patient privacy while enabling healthcare providers to do their jobs effectively.

Thanks for watching! If you build something with this, let me know in the comments. And if you have questions, drop them below - I read every one.

Until next time, stay secure, friends! 🔒"

🧵 Just published: Building a Complete HIPAA-Compliant Medical Records System with MongoDB

1/ The problem: Healthcare apps need encryption, but encrypted data can't be searched. You're forced to choose security OR functionality.

2/ MongoDB Queryable Encryption changes this. You can search encrypted data WITHOUT decrypting it on the server. True zero-knowledge security.

3/ In my new tutorial, we build a complete medical records system with:
• 5-role access control (Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, Patient)
• Medical knowledge base with clinical decision support
• Staff messaging system
• Patient portal
• Appointment scheduling
• Comprehensive audit logging

4/ The magic? Deterministic encryption for searchable fields, random encryption for maximum security. MongoDB handles the complexity.

5/ This isn't a toy demo - it's a production-ready system you can deploy today.

🏥 Just released: Complete HIPAA-Compliant Medical Records System with MongoDB

For years, developers have faced an impossible choice: secure encryption OR searchable databases. You couldn't have both.

MongoDB Queryable Encryption solves this.

In my new comprehensive tutorial, I walk through building a complete medical records system that:
✅ Encrypts patient data at the field level
✅ Enables searching WITHOUT decryption
✅ Implements 5-role access control (Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, Patient)
✅ Provides medical knowledge base with clinical decision support
✅ Includes staff messaging system
✅ Offers patient portal for self-service
✅ Supports appointment scheduling
✅ Provides comprehensive audit logging
✅ Meets HIPAA compliance requirements

The system uses:
• MongoDB 8.2 with Queryable Encryption
• Symfony 7.0 for the API
• Docker for deployment
• Real-world security patterns

Key insight: Even MongoDB database administrators can't see the plaintext patient data. True zero-knowledge security.

This is production-ready code you can actually deploy.

Title: [Tutorial] Complete HIPAA-Compliant Medical Records System with MongoDB Queryable Encryption and Symfony 7

I just published a comprehensive tutorial on building secure healthcare applications.

**The Problem:**
Encryption typically means you can't search your data. For healthcare apps, this is a dealbreaker.

**The Solution:**
MongoDB's Queryable Encryption lets you search encrypted data without decrypting it server-side.

**What's Covered:**
• Complete Symfony 7.0 API implementation
• Field-level encryption with MongoDB
• 5-role access control (Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, Patient)
• Medical knowledge base with clinical decision support
• Staff messaging system
• Patient portal for self-service
• Appointment scheduling
• HIPAA-compliant audit logging
• Docker deployment

**Why This Matters:**
• Zero-knowledge security - even DBAs can't see patient data
• Searchable encryption - full database functionality
• Production-ready - includes error handling, logging, security patterns
• Complete healthcare workflow - not just encryption

This is a complete medical records system, not just an encryption demo.

Full code on GitHub, 20-minute video walkthrough, detailed blog post with all the implementation details.
