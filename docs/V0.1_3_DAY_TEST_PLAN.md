# SecureHealth v0.1 - 3-Day AI-Assisted Test Plan

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Validate core MongoDB Queryable Encryption functionality and security for v0.1 release in 3 days using AI assistance.

**Focus**: Essential validation only - we'll leverage AI to automate test creation and execution where possible.

## Day 1: Critical Encryption & Security Validation

**AI-Assisted Approach**: Use AI to generate comprehensive test suites

```bash
# AI-Generated Test Creation (1 hour)
1. Prompt AI to create MongoDBEncryptionServiceTest.php
2. Prompt AI to create EncryptionIntegrationTest.php
3. AI generates test data factories for encryption testing

# Manual Validation (3 hours)
- [ ] Verify PHI fields are actually encrypted in database
- [ ] Test deterministic encryption on searchable fields (names, emails)
- [ ] Test random encryption on sensitive fields (SSN, diagnosis)
- [ ] Validate key vault security and separation
- [ ] Test encryption/decryption performance (basic benchmarks)
```

### Afternoon (4 hours): Security Voter Testing
**AI-Assisted Approach**: Use AI to expand existing test coverage

```bash
# AI-Generated Test Expansion (1 hour)

- [ ] Test environment variable configuration
```

### Afternoon (4 hours): Final Validation & Documentation
**AI-Assisted Approach**: Use AI to generate test reports and documentation

```bash
# AI-Assisted Documentation (1 hour)
1. Prompt AI to generate test execution report
2. Prompt AI to create deployment checklist
3. AI generates security validation summary

# Manual Final Validation (3 hours)
- [ ] Run complete test suite and validate results
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Validate SSL/TLS configuration
- [ ] Create final deployment package
- [ ] Document any remaining issues or limitations
```

## AI-Assisted Test Implementation Strategy

### Day 1 AI Prompts

```bash
# Prompt 1: Encryption Test Generation
"Generate a comprehensive PHPUnit test suite for MongoDBEncryptionService that validates:
1. Deterministic encryption on searchable fields (firstName, lastName, email)
2. Random encryption on sensitive fields (SSN, diagnosis, medications)
3. Key vault security and separation
4. Encryption/decryption performance benchmarks
5. Error handling for invalid keys"

# Prompt 2: Security Voter Test Expansion
"Expand the existing PatientVoterTest.php to cover all 30+ permission attributes across 5 roles:
1. Test admin role restrictions (cannot access medical data)
2. Test doctor full access capabilities
3. Test nurse limited access restrictions
4. Test receptionist demographic-only access
5. Test patient self-access limitations
Generate comprehensive test scenarios for each role-permission combination"
```

### Day 2 AI Prompts

```bash
# Prompt 3: Integration Test Generation
"Generate end-to-end integration tests for SecureHealth system:
1. Complete patient workflow (create → view → edit → delete)
2. Appointment scheduling workflow
3. Staff messaging workflow
4. Medical knowledge search workflow
5. Patient portal workflow
Include proper authentication, role-based access, and audit logging validation"

# Prompt 4: Security Test Generation
"Generate basic security validation tests:
1. Authentication bypass attempt scenarios
2. Audit logging validation for PHI access
3. Session security testing (timeout, fixation)
4. Input validation and sanitization testing
5. Role hierarchy inheritance validation"
```

### Day 3 AI Prompts

```bash
# Prompt 5: Performance Test Generation
"Generate performance testing scripts for SecureHealth:
1. Load testing with 100+ patient records
2. Encrypted vs unencrypted query performance comparison
3. Concurrent user access testing
4. Memory and CPU usage monitoring
5. Response time validation (<200ms for single operations)"

# Prompt 6: Deployment Test Generation
"Generate deployment validation tests:
1. Railway.app deployment process validation
2. MongoDB Atlas connection and encryption verification
3. Environment variable configuration testing
4. SSL/TLS certificate validation
5. Health check endpoint testing"
```

## Critical Success Criteria (Must Pass)

### Day 1 Success Criteria
- ✅ PHI fields are encrypted in database (visible validation)
- ✅ Key vault is secure and separate
- ✅ Role-based access control works correctly
- ✅ Admin cannot access medical data

### Day 2 Success Criteria
- ✅ Complete patient workflow functional
- ✅ Audit logging captures PHI access
- ✅ Session security mechanisms work
- ✅ Basic security validation passes

### Day 3 Success Criteria
- ✅ System handles realistic load (100+ patients)
- ✅ Encrypted queries perform within 2x of unencrypted
- ✅ Railway deployment successful
- ✅ Production environment functional

## Risk Mitigation for 3-Day Timeline

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Encryption Validation** - If encryption isn't working, we need fallback documentation
2. **Performance Issues** - If encrypted queries are too slow, we need optimization
3. **Deployment Issues** - If Railway deployment fails, we need local demo capability

### Contingency Plans
1. **Encryption Fallback**: Document non-encrypted mode for demo purposes
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement basic caching if needed
3. **Deployment Alternative**: Ensure local Docker setup works perfectly
