# SecureHealth Security Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive review of the SecureHealth system, this document identifies security gaps and provides recommendations for the v0.1 release. The system demonstrates strong security architecture but requires focused testing and validation to meet production-ready standards.

## Security Architecture Assessment

   - Fine-grained security voters (30+ permission attributes)
   - Proper password hashing with bcrypt

2. **MongoDB Queryable Encryption Implementation**
   - Field-level encryption properly configured
   - Appropriate algorithm selection (deterministic vs random)
   - Key management with separate key vault
   - Fallback mechanisms for deployment environments

3. **Audit Logging Framework**
   - Comprehensive audit trail for all PHI access
