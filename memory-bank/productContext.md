# Product Context

## Why SecureHealth Exists

SecureHealth was created to demonstrate best practices for building HIPAA-compliant healthcare applications using modern technologies, specifically showcasing MongoDB's queryable encryption capabilities for protecting Protected Health Information (PHI).

## Problems It Solves

### 1. Healthcare Data Security
**Problem**: Healthcare organizations must protect sensitive patient data while maintaining usability for authorized staff.

**Solution**: Implements MongoDB's Queryable Encryption (CSFLE) to encrypt PHI at the database level while still allowing authorized queries. Data remains encrypted even if the database is compromised.

### 2. HIPAA Compliance
**Problem**: Healthcare applications must comply with complex HIPAA regulations including access control, audit trails, and data protection.

**Solution**: 
- Comprehensive audit logging of all PHI access
- Role-based access control following "minimum necessary" principle
- Encrypted storage of all sensitive data
- Automatic compliance reporting capabilities

### 3. Role-Based Access Complexity
**Problem**: Different healthcare roles need different levels of access to patient information, making navigation and permissions complex.

**Solution**: 
- Symfony Security Voters for fine-grained permissions
- Role-aware navigation showing only relevant features
- Hierarchical role system (Doctor > Nurse > Receptionist)
- Clear visual indicators of user role and capabilities

### 4. Clinical Decision Support
**Problem**: Healthcare providers need quick access to medical knowledge during patient care.

**Solution**:
- Integrated medical knowledge base
- Drug interaction checking
- Treatment guidelines
- Diagnostic criteria reference
- Clinical decision support tools

2. Update contact information
3. Message healthcare providers
4. Request appointments
5. View test results (when available)

**Navigation**:
- Separate patient portal interface
- Simple, consumer-friendly design
- Focus on self-service tasks
- Clear communication channels

## User Experience Principles

### 1. Role-Appropriate Interface
Each user sees only what's relevant to their role, reducing cognitive load and preventing confusion.

### 2. Visual Hierarchy
- Primary actions (Calendar, Patients) at top level
- Grouped features in organized dropdowns
- Icons provide visual cues
- Active states show current location

### 3. Efficiency
- Minimal clicks to common tasks
- Keyboard navigation support
- Quick access to frequently used features
- Persistent navigation across pages

### 4. Clarity
- Clear labeling of capabilities
- Role badges visible in navbar
- Contextual help available
- Consistent terminology

### 5. Safety
- Confirmation for destructive actions
- Audit logging of all PHI access
- Session timeout for security
- Clear logout functionality
