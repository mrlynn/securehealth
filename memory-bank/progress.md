## Known Issues 🐛

### Critical
- None currently identified

### High Priority
1. ⚠️ Some navigation links may not handle query parameters correctly (e.g., `?tool=drug-interactions`)
2. ⚠️ User Management link points to anchor, needs dedicated page
3. ⚠️ Message route inconsistency between static pages and Symfony routes

### Medium Priority
4. ⚠️ Patient Portal navigation not yet updated with same improvements
5. ⚠️ Some pages use Bootstrap 4, others Bootstrap 5 (inconsistency)
6. ⚠️ Calendar view needs mobile optimization
7. ⚠️ Audit log filtering could be more sophisticated

### Low Priority
8. ⚠️ Some older debug pages still in public directory
9. ⚠️ Documentation could use more screenshots
10. ⚠️ Test coverage could be higher

## Performance Notes 📈

### What's Fast
- Patient list loading
- Authentication/authorization
