# SecureHealth Memory Bank

## About This Directory
The Memory Bank contains comprehensive documentation about the SecureHealth project. It serves as the primary knowledge base for understanding the system's architecture, current state, and future direction.

## Why Memory Bank?
As an AI assistant, my memory resets between sessions. The Memory Bank ensures continuity by documenting:
- Project goals and context
- Technical decisions and patterns
- Current progress and status
- Active work and next steps

This allows me (and other developers) to understand the project quickly and work effectively without repeating discoveries.

2. Review relevant sections in `systemPatterns.md`
3. Document your approach in `activeContext.md`
4. Update `progress.md` when complete

### When Encountering Issues
1. Document known issues in `progress.md`
2. Note workarounds in relevant documents
3. Update when issues are resolved

## Document Standards

### File Format
- Markdown (.md) for all documents
- Clear headings and structure
- Code examples where helpful
- Diagrams using ASCII or mermaid when needed

### Writing Style
- Clear and concise
- Technical but accessible
- Include examples
- Assume reader is intelligent but new to project

## Questions?

The Memory Bank should answer most questions about the project. If you can't find something:
1. Check if it should be documented (and add it!)
2. Ask in project communications
3. Document the answer for future reference

Remember: The Memory Bank is only useful if it's kept current!
