# Active Context

## Current Focus
**AI-Enhanced Patient Detail Page Complete** - Successfully integrated comprehensive AI documentation capabilities directly into the patient detail page, enabling doctors to leverage LLM-powered tools for clinical documentation without leaving the patient context.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)

### RAG Chatbot Implementation
Successfully implemented a comprehensive HIPAA-compliant AI chatbot system with the following features:

#### Key Achievements:
1. **RAGChatbotService Implementation**
   - Intelligent query classification (knowledge vs data queries)
   - Vector search integration with MongoDB Atlas
   - Function calling for patient data access
   - Role-based access control integration

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/chatbot/query` - Main chatbot interaction endpoint
   - `/api/chatbot/status` - User capabilities and status
   - `/api/chatbot/examples` - Role-based example queries

3. **Floating Chatbot UI**
   - Modern, responsive design with gradient animations
   - Real-time conversation interface
   - Examples panel with role-based suggestions
   - Character counting and input validation
   - HIPAA compliance indicators

4. **Integration & Security**
   - Integrated across all application pages (HTML, Twig templates)
   - Comprehensive audit logging for all interactions
   - Respects Symfony Voter permissions
   - No PHI stored in conversation history

#### Technical Features:
- **Knowledge Queries**: Uses RAG with vector search to answer questions about MongoDB, HIPAA, and application features
- **Patient Data Queries**: Function calling for patient search, diagnosis viewing, and drug interaction checking
- **Role-Based Access**: Different capabilities for Admin, Doctor, Nurse, and Receptionist roles
- **Cost Effective**: Efficient OpenAI API usage with vector search optimization

### Railway Deployment Resolution
Successfully resolved critical deployment issues and achieved fully functional application state on Railway.app platform.

#### Key Achievements:
1. **FrankenPHP Configuration Fixed**
   - Resolved PHP file processing issues with proper `php_server` directive
   - Fixed API routing with correct rewrite rules for Symfony
   - Eliminated 405 Method Not Allowed errors on API endpoints

2. **Session Management Resolved**
   - Fixed session persistence by removing incorrect cookie domain configuration
   - Extended session lifetime to 24 hours (86400 seconds)
   - Implemented proper session storage in `/tmp/sessions` for Railway
   - Fixed LoginSuccessHandler to store user data in session

3. **Authentication System Working**
   - Login functionality fully operational
   - Session persistence working across page requests
   - API authentication working correctly
   - Role-based access control functioning properly

4. **Backup & Restore Strategy Implemented**
   - Created git tag `v1.0-working-state` for easy restoration
   - Created backup branch `backup-working-state`
   - Developed restore script with multiple restore options
   - Comprehensive documentation of working state created

### Current Working State
- ✅ Railway deployment functional on securehealth.dev
- ✅ Login working for all user roles
- ✅ Session persistence (24-hour lifetime)
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Dashboard loading without errors
- ✅ Medical Knowledge Base accessible
- ✅ Navigation system working properly

## Next Steps
1. Continue with planned feature development
2. Implement remaining high-priority features (User Management, Medical Knowledge Management)
3. Execute comprehensive testing of current working state
4. Plan next development sprint with confidence in stable foundation

## Active Decisions
- Using dropdown menus to organize related functionality by role
- Keeping critical functions (Calendar, Patients) at top level
- Grouping clinical tools for doctors to reduce navbar clutter
- Providing role-appropriate labels ("Manage" vs "View" for patient notes)
- Maintaining consistency between JS navbar (static pages) and Twig navbar (Symfony routes)

## Known Considerations
- Some pages referenced in navigation may need updates to handle query parameters (e.g., `?tool=drug-interactions`)
- User Management link points to anchor (`/admin.html#users`) - may need dedicated page
- Patient Portal has separate navigation system - not updated in this change
- Messages route differs between systems (`/staff/messages` vs Symfony route `staff_messages_inbox`)
