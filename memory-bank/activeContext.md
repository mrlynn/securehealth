# Active Context

## Current Focus
Optimizing navigation and user experience based on role-based access control capabilities.

## Recent Changes (October 8, 2025)

### Navigation System Overhaul
Updated both JavaScript-based navbar (`public/assets/js/navbar.js`) and Twig-based navbar (`templates/includes/navbar.html.twig`) to provide comprehensive, role-aware navigation that exposes all capabilities for each user role.

#### Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced Patients Dropdown**
   - Added icons for better visual hierarchy
   - Role-specific options (Patient Notes for doctors/nurses, Scheduling for receptionists)
   
2. **New "Clinical Tools" Dropdown for Doctors**
   - Medical Knowledge search
   - Clinical Decision Support
   - Drug Interactions checker
   - Treatment Guidelines
   - Diagnostic Criteria
   - Audit Logs access
   
3. **New "Medical Tools" Dropdown for Nurses**
   - Drug Interactions checker (their primary medical knowledge access)
   - Medical Knowledge (view-only)
   
4. **Enhanced Admin Dropdown**
   - Dashboard with audit logs
   - Demo Data management
   - Medical Knowledge management
   - Encryption Search demonstration
   - User Management (placeholder)
   
5. **Improved Navigation for All Roles**
   - Calendar (all authenticated users)
   - Messages with unread badge (doctors/nurses)
   - Scheduling (receptionists)
   - Consistent icon usage across all menu items

## Next Steps
1. Test navigation with each role to ensure proper access control
2. Verify all links lead to existing, functional pages
3. Consider adding breadcrumbs for better navigation context
4. Review patient portal navigation separately
5. Add keyboard navigation support for accessibility

## Active Decisions
- Using dropdown menus to organize related functionality by role
- Keeping critical functions (Calendar, Patients) at top level
- Grouping clinical tools for doctors to reduce navbar clutter
- Providing role-appropriate labels ("Manage" vs "View" for patient notes)
- Maintaining consistency between JS navbar (static pages) and Twig navbar (Symfony routes)

## Known Considerations
- Some pages referenced in navigation may need updates to handle query parameters (e.g., `?tool=drug-interactions`)
- User Management link points to anchor (`/admin.html#users`) - may need dedicated page
- Patient Portal has separate navigation system - not updated in this change
- Messages route differs between systems (`/staff/messages` vs Symfony route `staff_messages_inbox`)
