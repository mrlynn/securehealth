# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Railway Deployment Successfully Functional** - Application is now fully operational on Railway with working authentication, session management, and API endpoints.

## Recent Changes (October 21, 2025)

### Railway Deployment Resolution
Successfully resolved critical deployment issues and achieved fully functional application state on Railway.app platform.

#### Key Achievements:
1. **FrankenPHP Configuration Fixed**
   - Resolved PHP file processing issues with proper `php_server` directive
   - Fixed API routing with correct rewrite rules for Symfony
   - Eliminated 405 Method Not Allowed errors on API endpoints

2. **Session Management Resolved**
   - Fixed session persistence by removing incorrect cookie domain configuration
   - Extended session lifetime to 24 hours (86400 seconds)
   - Implemented proper session storage in `/tmp/sessions` for Railway
   - Fixed LoginSuccessHandler to store user data in session

3. **Authentication System Working**
   - Login functionality fully operational
   - Session persistence working across page requests
   - API authentication working correctly
   - Role-based access control functioning properly

4. **Backup & Restore Strategy Implemented**
   - Created git tag `v1.0-working-state` for easy restoration
   - Created backup branch `backup-working-state`
   - Developed restore script with multiple restore options
   - Comprehensive documentation of working state created

### Current Working State
- ✅ Railway deployment functional on securehealth.dev
- ✅ Login working for all user roles
- ✅ Session persistence (24-hour lifetime)
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Dashboard loading without errors
- ✅ Medical Knowledge Base accessible
- ✅ Navigation system working properly

## Next Steps
1. Continue with planned feature development
2. Implement remaining high-priority features (User Management, Medical Knowledge Management)
3. Execute comprehensive testing of current working state
4. Plan next development sprint with confidence in stable foundation

## Active Decisions
- Using dropdown menus to organize related functionality by role
- Keeping critical functions (Calendar, Patients) at top level
- Grouping clinical tools for doctors to reduce navbar clutter
- Providing role-appropriate labels ("Manage" vs "View" for patient notes)
- Maintaining consistency between JS navbar (static pages) and Twig navbar (Symfony routes)

## Known Considerations
- Some pages referenced in navigation may need updates to handle query parameters (e.g., `?tool=drug-interactions`)
- User Management link points to anchor (`/admin.html#users`) - may need dedicated page
- Patient Portal has separate navigation system - not updated in this change
- Messages route differs between systems (`/staff/messages` vs Symfony route `staff_messages_inbox`)
