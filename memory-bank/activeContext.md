# Active Context

## Current Focus
Comprehensive system review and v0.1 release test planning for MongoDB Queryable Encryption educational demonstration.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)

### System Architecture Review
Completed comprehensive analysis of SecureHealth system architecture, security implementation, and MongoDB Queryable Encryption capabilities.

#### Key Findings:
1. **Strong Security Architecture**
   - Comprehensive role-based access control (5 roles with 30+ permissions)
   - MongoDB Queryable Encryption properly implemented
   - Session-based authentication with proper security configuration
   - Comprehensive audit logging framework

2. **Critical Testing Gaps Identified**
   - Missing encryption validation test suites
   - Incomplete security voter testing
   - Insufficient audit log integrity validation
   - No end-to-end encryption testing

3. **Production Readiness Assessment**
   - Core functionality: ~85% complete
   - Security implementation: ~95% complete
   - Test coverage: ~60% complete
   - Documentation: ~75% complete

### v0.1 Release Test Plan Created
Developed comprehensive 4-week test plan focusing on:
- MongoDB Queryable Encryption validation
- Security and compliance testing
- Integration and performance testing
- Deployment and production readiness

## Next Steps
1. Implement critical test suites (encryption, security voters, audit logging)
2. Execute Phase 1 testing (Core Functionality Validation)
3. Address security gaps identified in gap analysis
4. Validate HIPAA compliance requirements
5. Prepare for v0.1 release deployment

## Active Decisions
- Using dropdown menus to organize related functionality by role
- Keeping critical functions (Calendar, Patients) at top level
- Grouping clinical tools for doctors to reduce navbar clutter
- Providing role-appropriate labels ("Manage" vs "View" for patient notes)
- Maintaining consistency between JS navbar (static pages) and Twig navbar (Symfony routes)

## Known Considerations
- Some pages referenced in navigation may need updates to handle query parameters (e.g., `?tool=drug-interactions`)
- User Management link points to anchor (`/admin.html#users`) - may need dedicated page
- Patient Portal has separate navigation system - not updated in this change
- Messages route differs between systems (`/staff/messages` vs Symfony route `staff_messages_inbox`)
