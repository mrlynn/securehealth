# Security

The security of patient data is paramount in healthcare applications. SecureHealth implements a comprehensive security model to protect Protected Health Information (PHI) in compliance with HIPAA regulations.

## Security Model

SecureHealth employs a layered security model:

1. **Field-level Encryption** - Individual PHI fields are encrypted before storing in MongoDB
2. **Role-based Access Control** - Users can only access data appropriate to their role
3. **Comprehensive Audit Logging** - All data access is logged for compliance
4. **Secure Key Management** - Encryption keys are securely managed and separated from data

- [Access Control](access-control) - Role-based permissions and minimum necessary access
- [Audit Trails](audit-trails) - Tracking data access for compliance
- [Key Management](key-management) - Managing encryption keys securely

## HIPAA Compliance

SecureHealth is designed with HIPAA compliance in mind, implementing the technical safeguards required by the HIPAA Security Rule:

- **Access Controls** - Unique user identification, automatic logoff, encryption
- **Audit Controls** - Hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms to record and examine activity
- **Integrity Controls** - Measures to ensure that PHI is not improperly altered or destroyed
- **Transmission Security** - Measures to guard against unauthorized access to PHI being transmitted over a network

## Best Practices

When extending SecureHealth, always follow these security best practices:

- Always use `Patient::toArray()` method to ensure proper role-based filtering
- Log all sensitive data access using `AuditLogService`
- Use Security Voters for authorization decisions
- Never store encryption keys in your application code
- Always validate input data server-side before processing
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
